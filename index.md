### What is KIP-7? What is Klaytn?

<img src="assets/images/klaytn.jpg" width="200"/>

[Klaytn](https://www.klaytn.com/) is an enterprise-grade, service-centric platform developed by Kakao, Korea. Klaytn, the currency running on the platform, is the 39th largest cryptocurrency in crypto market capitalization.

KIP-7 is a fungible Klaytn Compatible Token (KCT) that has properties of uniformity and divisibility, which is very similar to ERC-20 from Ethereum.

Differences with ERC - 20 are:

- More optional functions are included (e.g. mint, burn and pause extension).
- Every token transfer/mint/burn MUST be tracked by event logs. This means that a Transaction MUST be emitted for any action related to transfer/mint/burn.
- The KIP-13 interface for each method group MUST be implemented.

KIP-7 tokens are easily exchangeable in [KLAYswap](https://klayswap.com/), the Klaytn's DeFi solution that can take advantage of this high liquidity environment.
